# titanic_survival_exploration

This repository contains project file for Project 0 - Titanic Survival Exploration as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

#Description
In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age.Start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.
